Working on:
Dynamic batching with bins or similar... need to work from ground up here.
Decided that it is better to get rid of masking alltogether, and keep batches continuous.

Next task:
Train a custom tokenizer

Questions:
- How do batching approaches affect model convergence / learning efficency & training speed 
- - That is, continuous batching vs. binned/fix lengthed batching.
